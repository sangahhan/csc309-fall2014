#TODO
1. The object oriented Ness. So like. Create objects for ball, paddle, and bricks. Maybe they inherit from a game piece class because they all have x, y, and imgurl.  And a canvas. 
2. The animation of the ball and paddle. Just a lot of checking of the x and y's of the ball and paddle. I imagine something like 'testHit' in the InteractiveShapes example. 
3. What happens when we hit bricks / scoring system plus I believe there are two levels. But I imagine since its only two, we can just have an int somewhere indicating level. How should we handle when the user wins or loses? 
- fix the hit bricks issue
- add the handling of hitting the ground-- including popping a ball as well as if there are no more balls left
- add the handling of winning
- also noticed a weird issue with testHitPaddle... where if it hits a certain point, it'll just start moving horizontally really shaky... <-- S
4. Styling.
